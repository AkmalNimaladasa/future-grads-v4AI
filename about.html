    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Future Grads International Academy was founded in 2002 by Mrs. Yasmin Faiz Nimaladasa in Ratmalana with a vision to nurture children with care, values, and strong educational foundations. Over 23 years later, our alumni still return as adults — a testament to the love and trust built through years of dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as a small Montessori has grown into a trusted institution offering Daycare and soon, an International Primary School. Our strength lies not just in academics, but in the lifelong relationships we form with families.

    <h2>Founder's Message</h2>
    <p>
      “When parents come back years later, thanking me for the foundation their children received — I know I've done something right. At Future Grads, we treat each child with the care we would give our own.”
